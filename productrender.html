        <h1 class='model-title'>Illuminaut Kinetic Sculpture Lamp</h1><p class='model-description'>The Illuminaut design is an aesthetically pleasing lamp structure that blends into office green spaces. The styling allows for viewers to see individual pieces working together. While viewing, it encourages ideation and thought process to overall enhance office/studio life. A highly variable wing shape allows it to not only be around foliage but also as a hanging fixture or stand alone structure.</p></div>

        <img alt="The lamp in it's prime variation." class='model-image' src='img/productmodel/337Render.jpg'><h2 class='model-desc inner'>Illuminaut is designed to encourage thought and ideas throughout the day.</h2><p class='model-description inner'>In any studio or office setting there are times when one must take a break and look around in their environment. Once seen, the simple mechanics of Illuminaut gives intrigue and wonder: "How does it work?", "It's a very simple mechanism", "Simple yet functional". Thinking over these simple questions allows for respite as well as thoughts to flow overall giving a new and fresh attitude towards what they were working on in the first place.</p><img alt='Second Configuration for overhead hanging.' class='model-image' src='img/productmodel/337Render4.jpg'><img alt='Stand alone configuration for larger display.' class='model-image' src='img/productmodel/337Render2.jpg'><div class='model-description inner'><h2 class='model-desc role'>My Role:</h2><p class='model-description L'>Brainstorming initial ideas and iterations, Creating persona users, User research, 3D modeling, Prototyping and building</p><p class='model-description R'>Tools: Pen and paper, Solidworks, Adobe Phototshop, Adobe Illustrator</p></div><img alt='Multiple Illuminauts in differnt configuations' class='model-image' src='img/productmodel/lamps.JPG'><h2 class='model-desc inner'>Not only is it simple in it's mechanics, it also mimics natural plant life by opening and closing it's wings</h2><p class='model-description inner'>The question was simple: "What can this lamp do besides light up the room for office/studio workers?" Illuminaut's answer was to allow for thoughts to flow thus it encourages creativity through simplicity. Through prototyping and user feedback what we discovered was that nothing was better than something simple or like a small gadget to look at or fiddle around to get thoughts flowing</p><div class='model-description inner'><p class='model-description L'>The wings mimic how plants like to shrink or cover up when there isn't enough light. Illuminaut's wings fold in and out depending on the time of day and act as light dampeners all in one to simulate the time of day to compliment natural light.</p><p class='model-description R'>The target users were studio or office workers. Users who are taking short or longer breaks and need something else to view as a change of pace.</p></div>
