These two important documents inform the most important details of the District of Mission's Planning efforts. The goal then was to take and adapt the goals and principles into the waterfront area itself.</p><a class="model-image-link" href="img/missionwaterfront/waterfrontpicsfull.png"><img alt="Waterfront Site Pictures" class="model-image" src="img/missionwaterfront/waterfrontpicsboth.png"></a><a class="model-image-link" href="img/missionwaterfront/externalinformation.png"><img alt="icbc crash infromation and environmental design" class="model-image" src="img/missionwaterfront/externalinformation.png"></a><div class="model-description inner"><p class="model-description L">The information researched then required a site visit. Knowing what the area was exactly by being there is a good approach and ground our understanding of the area. Pictures were taken and reviewed while referencing maps of the area.</p><p class="model-description R">Information from external sources was researched such as ways to plan for the waterfront area itself in design. Examples of successful cities that had the same planning problems as what the new neighbourhood faces would be used as rationale for planning directions and environmental concerns looked at from a transportation perspective.</p></div><a class="model-image-link" href="img/missionwaterfront/BikePathing.jpg"><img alt="Mission Bike path" class="model-image" src="img/missionwaterfront/BikePathing.jpg"></a><a class="model-image-link" href="img/missionwaterfront/ptriangle.PNG"><img alt="Road Hierarchy" class="model-image" src="img/missionwaterfront/ptriangle.PNG"></a><a class="model-image-link" href="img/missionwaterfront/RoadNetwork1.png"><img alt="Mission Waterfront Area Road Network" class="model-image" src="img/missionwaterfront/RoadNetwork1.png"></a><a class="model-image-link" href="img/missionwaterfront/RoadNetwork2.png"><img alt="Waterfront Area Bypass Zone" class="model-image" src="img/missionwaterfront/RoadNetwork2.png"></a><p class="model-description inner single">From research we found that the area is underutilized full of commercial business and a largely disconnected and mixed use of road hierarchy. Mission going forward wanted the ability to focus on pedestrians first and environmental protection with private vehicle use at the lowest. There were two large issues: One was the physical limitations of how the train tracks were positioned limiting connections to the downtown core while the other is the planned highway bypass that will shape the overall structure of the neighbourhoodâ€™s network. With these findings we then proceeded to create the document itself and how it will relate to the District of Mission in its entirety.</p><hr><h2 class="model-desc inner">Focus: Report Design and Writing</h2><a class="model-image-link" href="img/missionwaterfront/plancontentboth1_full.png"><img alt="Transportation Strategy Frontpage &amp; Contents" class="model-image" src="img/missionwaterfront/plancontentboth1.png"></a><p class="model-description inner single">From the research phase we then distributed the strategy's content and I was to write the Road Network portion, part of the environmental concerns, and the design of the overall document. The design of the document itself was made in likeness of the District of Mission's Master Transportation Strategy. This allows for ready adaptation and a clear relation by design. The document itself is also designed to be simple and readable with icons that are easy to understand.</p><a class="model-image-link" href="img/missionwaterfront/plancontentboth2_full.png"><img alt="Transportation Strategy Road Network Contents" class="model-image" src="img/missionwaterfront/plancontentboth2.png"></a><a class="model-image-link" href="img/missionwaterfront/plancontentboth3_full.png"><img alt="Transportation Strategy Road Network Contents" class="model-image" src="img/missionwaterfront/plancontentboth3.png"></a><div class="model-description inner"><p class="model-description L">For road network planning I used the research to give rationale into what the road network would be shaped. The planned network would focus on pedestrian first; A clear hierarchy of roads, using the Waterfront as a mobility core in the north, a waterfront pedestrian zone by the river, and leveraging bypass designs to favour better connections.</p><p class="model-description R">The environmental portion I was to write for consisted of two sections. The first was to investigate strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions via consolidating public transit and encouraging pedestrian / cycling connections to destinations. The second was the material and design of the roads themselves. Strategies involving using permeable surfaces, a "complete street" design pattern, and using best construction practices with qualifiable actions.</p></div></section>

The strategy is ready to be adapted by the planning depart for their engagements. From this I understood and worked on an engagement document from policies and goals directly from the District of Mission. I also practiced report design for the planning field and overall created an aesthetically pleasing report with rationale ready to be used.</p><div class="model-description inner"><a href="missionpresentation.pdf" id="project-inner-link">Full Presentation</a></div></section>
