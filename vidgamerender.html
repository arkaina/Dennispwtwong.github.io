<h1 class="model-title">Virtual Reality Immersion</h1>
<h2 class="model-desc">UX/Game Design, Developer</h2><p class="model-description">This stylized game world explores the effects on an individual's life when faced with obligations that are a deterrent to themselves. Using the Oculus Rift virtual reality helmet, this experience is designed to understand and generate empathy for the issue. I brainstormed and refined the idea and went on to create a tangible example of it working and shown to the public.</p></div>

Various obstacles bar them from going on off on their own free will even if there is a clear path forward. This project was a UX design within a game context on the topic of
<b>empathy.</b>
It was also where I was to use my broad skillset in design, programming, and project management.</p><a class="model-image-link" href="img/vidgamemodel/FoggyBog_cropped.jpg"><img alt="Fogged marsh area of the game." class="model-image" src="img/vidgamemodel/FoggyBog_cropped_1280.jpg"></a><div class="model-description inner"><h2 class="model-desc role">My Role:</h2><p class="model-description L">Programming game elements/actions, models(sword, shield, and land environments), prototyping, design direction, project manager of group of 4.</p><p class="model-description R">Tools: Unity, Maya, Oculus Rift, Persona creation, Brainstorm sessions.

<section class="process isOnScreen" id="process"><hr class="content"><h1 class="model-desc">Part 2: Process</h1><h2 class="model-desc inner">Focus Area: Research and Framework</h2><p class="model-description inner single">This short adventure seems easy but it asks a question: Why must they do this? Exploring the concept of forced cooperation, the voice commands the player to find items of questionable worth to themselves and ventures off to reveal a deadly end through blind faith/forced cooperation.</p><div class="model-description inner"><p class="model-description L">During idea generation, we decided to use a polygon style world to give a surreal experience and using an unseen voice to portray the obligations within an individual's mind. The voice itself actively responds to the user speaking through a mic while watching the progress go on to create a unique experience. While considered to use a questionnaire about themselves before hand, it was deemed too uncomfortable.</p><p class="model-description R">The target users were geared towards a pre-teen, teen, and young-adult audience who were often under obligation to others/authority, showing them a perspective to help clear their minds and reflect. It was also geared towards adults whom are disconnected with such situations; why would they care if they never have experienced it? The voice would try to engage sarcastically as possible to the players as well as demanding attention to immerse them as much as possible to the situation.</p></div><a class="model-image-link" href="img/vidgamemodel/CreepyForest_cropped.jpg"><img alt="Inside the dark forest." class="model-image" src="img/vidgamemodel/CreepyForest_cropped_1280.jpg"></a><hr><h2 class="model-desc inner">Focus Area: Designing, Programming, and Presentation</h2><p class="model-description inner single">The next step was to create the space using the art direction via Unity, the Oculus Rift, and Maya. I created the sword, shield, and other objects and brought them into Unity. The code that followed the models were overall programmed by me in C#: Creating the appropriate events, triggers, and effects that would be used in the experience.</p><a class="model-image-link" href="img/vidgamemodel/sword_and_shield.jpg"><img alt="Sword and shield models." class="model-image" src="img/vidgamemodel/sword_and_shield_1280.jpg"></a><a class="model-image-link" href="img/vidgamemodel/EndingArea_cropped.jpg"><img alt="Ending meadow area full of chess pieces around and in a ditch." class="model-image" src="img/vidgamemodel/EndingArea_cropped_1280.jpg"></a><h2 class="model-desc inner">Public Showcase generated interesting results</h2><p class="model-description inner single">As part of a showcase of various VR work about "empathy", the results of the users were mixed: the idea was understood but half of the participants took the experience as a challenge against themselves and the game's limitations and went against what the voice commands at every-turn. When asked casually about the experience after, they said they had fun while saying they did understand the undertone of forced obligation.</p></section>
<section class="takeaway isOnScreen" id="takeaway"><hr class="content"><h1 class="model-desc">Part 3: Reflection</h1><p class="model-description inner single">It made me happy that people enjoyed our experience. It allowed me to use my generalist skillset in a variety of roles: Project Manager, UX Designer, and Developer. Although I focus on UX design, it does not bar me from being able to do more than design and actually create and organize others to do the same.</p></section>
