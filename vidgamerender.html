<h1 class="model-title">Virtual Reality Immersion</h1><p class="model-description">This stylized game world explores the effects on an individual's life when faced with obligations that are a deterrent to themselves. Using the Oculus Rift virtual reality helmet, this experience is designed to understand and generate empathy for the issue. I brainstormed and refined the idea and went on to create a tangible example of it working and shown to the public.</p></div>

<img alt="Overview of the virtual world." class="model-image" src="img/vidgamemodel/Overview_Cropped.jpg"><h2 class="model-desc inner">As a person bound by the word of an overseer unseen, enter the world and do its bidding in this stylized game world.</h2><p class="model-description inner">In the world the player is constantly micromanaged by a sarcastic and annoying voice that constantly reminds them of their status and position. Various obstacles bar them from going on off on their own free will even if there is a clear path forward.</p><img alt="Fogged marsh area of the game." class="model-image" src="img/vidgamemodel/FoggyBog_cropped.jpg"><div class="model-description inner"><h2 class="model-desc role">My Role:</h2><p class="model-description L">Programming game elements/actions, models(sword, shield, and land environments), prototyping, design direction, project manager of group of 4.</p><p class="model-description R">Tools: Unity, Maya, Oculus Rift, Persona creation, Brainstorm sessions. Scenes/Models rendered using Unity.</p></div><img alt="Inside the dark forest." class="model-image" src="img/vidgamemodel/CreepyForest_cropped.jpg"><h2 class="model-desc inner">This short adventure seems easy but it asks a question: Why must they do this?</h2><p class="model-description inner">Exploring the concept of forced cooperation, the voice commands the player to find items of questionable worth to themselves and ventures off to reveal a deadly end through blind faith/forced cooperation.</p><div class="model-description inner"><p class="model-description L">During idea generation, we decided to use a polygon style world to give a surreal experience and using an unseen voice to portray the obligations within an individual's mind. The voice itself actively responds to the user speaking through a mic while watching the progress go on to create a unique experience. While considered to use a questionnaire about themselves before hand, it was deemed too uncomfortable.</p><p class="model-description R">The target users were geared towards a pre-teen, teen, and young-adult audience who were often under obligation to others/authority, showing them a perspective to help clear their minds and reflect. It was also geared towards adults whom are disconnected with such situations; why would they care if they never have experienced it? The voice would try to engage sarcastically as possible to the players as well as demanding attention to immerse them as much as possible to the situation.</p></div><img alt="Sword and shield models." class="model-image" src="img/vidgamemodel/sword_and_shield.jpg"><img alt="Ending meadow area full of chess pieces around and in a ditch." class="model-image" src="img/vidgamemodel/EndingArea_cropped.jpg">
