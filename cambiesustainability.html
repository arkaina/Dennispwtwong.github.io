Within are considerations for site history, physical constraints, neighbourhood characteristics, and the site's relationship with the rest of the community it connects to and beyond.</p><div class="model-description inner" id="project-div-link"><a href="sexsmithsitecompplan.pdf" id="project-mid-link">Full Document</a></div>

<section class="process isOnScreen" id="process"><hr class="content"><h1 class="model-desc">Part 2: Process</h1><h2 class="model-desc inner">Focus: Site, Policy & Engagement</h2><a class="model-image-link" href="img/cambiecomprehensive/planoverview3.png"><img alt="Sexsmith Site Plan Overview" class="model-image" src="img/cambiecomprehensive/overview4.png"></a><p class="model-description inner single">At the start of the project was the need to research just what the site is and how it relates to the City of Vancouver. While working with scheduling as team leader, I researched and analyzed information to express sustainable actions while contributing to the community.</p><a class="model-image-link" href="img/cambiecomprehensive/historypaste2.png"><img alt="Sexsmith Site Plan History and Opportunities" class="model-image" src="img/cambiecomprehensive/historypaste.png"></a><p class="model-description inner single">Before being able to recommend actions for the proposed site planning, however, I took to review official community plans and strategies related with my team. Referencing it with the area's history, I narrowed down what should the site focus on as a community for the future on their strengths and weaknesses.</p><a class="model-image-link" href="img/cambiecomprehensive/policiespaste1_2.png"><img alt="Sexsmith Site Policy Review 1" class="model-image" src="img/cambiecomprehensive/policiespaste1_1.png"></a><a class="model-image-link" href="img/cambiecomprehensive/policiespaste2_2.png"><img alt="Sexsmith Site Policy Review 2" class="model-image" src="img/cambiecomprehensive/policiespaste2_1.png"></a><p class="model-description inner single">Policies reviewed included from regional to city down to Marpole as a community and aspects such as transportation and housing strategies. These would become the foundation on how I would base the actions and planning with understanding of the site and the desires of the City of Vancouver.</p><a class="model-image-link" href="img/cambiecomprehensive/vision2.PNG"><img alt="SexSmith Site Vision" class="model-image" src="img/cambiecomprehensive/vision1_1.png"></a><a class="model-image-link" href="img/cambiecomprehensive/vision4.PNG"><img alt="Sexsmith Site Vision 2" class="model-image" src="img/cambiecomprehensive/vision4.PNG"></a><a class="model-image-link" href="img/cambiecomprehensive/vision3.PNG"><img alt="Sexsmith Site Vision 3" class="model-image" src="img/cambiecomprehensive/vision3.PNG"></a><div class="model-description inner"><p class="model-description L">Processing down the information I then concluded the site's vision and purpose as a unique part of the community of Marpole while balancing the harmony with neighbouring areas such as the business heavy Cambie Corridor.</p><p class="model-description R">Several values are then highlighted for the future site focusing on 5 in particular: Complete & Healthy Community, Diverse Housing, Environmental Concerns, Culture, and Historic importance. These will shape what actions the site will be planned.</p></div><a class="model-image-link" href="img/cambiecomprehensive/engagement.JPG"><img alt="Sexsmith Site Vision 3" class="model-image" src="img/cambiecomprehensive/engagement.JPG"></a><p class="model-description inner single">As part of the planning process and actions, an engagement strategy was made to line up the plan with public engagement. This allows the plan to be modified as feedback is gained and iterated upon.</p><hr><h2 class="model-desc inner">Focus: "Complete Block" & Actions</h2><a class="model-image-link" href="img/cambiecomprehensive/topview.JPG"><img alt="Sexsmith Site Implementation render" class="model-image" src="img/cambiecomprehensive/topview.JPG"></a><p class="model-description inner single">After research and analysis on the site and policy related, I translated the information into actions and recommendations as comprehensive planning and build form. One idea to note was the decision to create a "complete block" as part of the community. This distinction fits the idea to give identity to the site and comprehensive sustainable land-use planning for the community east of Marpole it would serve.</p><a class="model-image-link" href="img/cambiecomprehensive/completeblock.PNG"><img alt="Land Designations" class="model-image" src="img/cambiecomprehensive/completeblock.PNG"></a><p class="model-description inner single">As part of planning the report looked at development, real estate patterns, the public realm and other elements that all worked together to create a "complete block". It would incorporate them into charts and plans laid out to view and consider. The focus will work towards a block that, when built, ensures various housing, mixed-use, and open area options following a good base.</p><a class="model-image-link" href="img/cambiecomprehensive/actionsfull3.png"><img alt="Sexsmith public realm and transportation actions" class="model-image" src="img/cambiecomprehensive/actionsshowing.png"></a><a class="model-image-link" href="img/cambiecomprehensive/actions3.PNG"><img alt="Site transportation flow map" class="model-image" src="img/cambiecomprehensive/actions3.PNG"></a><div class="model-description inner"><p class="model-description L">The portion I contributed as the primary planner was the public realm and transportation network portions of the report. I concluded that the site would serve as a perfect linkage for Marpole in terms of north and south cycling routes to west and east while keeping the local capacity of traffic and how it would affect the neighbourhood.</p><p class="model-description R">The public realm will work towards the site's strengths: community care and bringing the site's history into focus while creating areas for rest and relaxation. Community amenities are to bolster the need for family necessities, recreation, and child-care; a large point to make as surrounding neighbourhoods have heavier retail and traffic compared to the site itself.</p></div></section>

It gives good narrative for the site's design and plan as readers will understand why each facet is planned. Implementation and actions shown through were made in adobe illustrator, AutoCAD, Excel, and SketchUp.</p><p class="model-description inner single">Throughout this report I used my skills in planning, graphical design, and team leadership. I strengthened my skills and familiarity of planning policies as it applied to various research and higher thinking exercises. The project itself needed a schedule and management to keep it on track and I believe I had done well in creating a report that is both full of effective information and pleasing to read in.</p></section>
